# 💬 Projects
#### *2021.09 ~ Now* A hybrid platform based on SDWAN and tunnel forwarding (For self use)
**Intro:** This project is designed to cater to cross-campus and remote office applications, utilizing Zerotier to establish network routing for research groups across different campuses. It is further complemented by stable tunnel forwarding systems using Frp and Cloudflare Tunnel. Based on this foundation, we deploy services such as Emby, Sharelatex, One-api, and WebDAV with the integration of advanced technologies like Docker and SDWAN. The platform offers a range of functionalities including cross-campus access to large-scale computing resources of the research groups, support for online writing of private LaTeX cloud documents, utilization of the LLM API purchased by the research group with access control, online viewing of meetings and recorded courses, as well as synchronization of software information (incorporating WebDAV capabilities).
